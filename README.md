# Recipe Analysis
## By Téa Hajratwala ([hajtwt@umich.edu](mailto:hajtwt@umich.edu)) and Devdeep Rajpal ([devdeep@umich.edu](mailto:devdeep@umich.edu))


### Introduction
We are using a portion of a dataset from food.com, containing data regarding each recipie posted to the site. Our truncated set starts from 2008 to current day. From the data, we focused on dealing with a few select portions of this dataset:
- Nutrition
  - Calories
  - Total Fat
  - Sugar
  - Sodium
  - Protein
  - Saturated Fat
  - Carbohydrates
- Minutes for each recipe
- Average Rating

We set out to try and predict the number of calories in a recipe based on the above factors, with the hope of using this predictor as part of analysis of recipes' health.

### Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis
#### Inital Data Cleaning
To clean this data for use, we took a handful of steps. We have a few of separate datasets, so we first had to merge a couple of them together for use. We then filled the ratings of zero with `np.nan` to allow our means to be accurate. As those means are calculated by `Pandas`, setting all 0 values to `np.nan` means they will be ignored.

We then took our third dataset, containing individual review data, and found the average rating for each recipe. With this, we then merged that data into our previous dataframe based on the recipe IDs. Now that all the data is in one place, we set the index of our data to those aformentioned IDs, and then made a new dataframe with all of thise data grouped by recipe ID.

Still, there was some work to do in individual columns. We took our nutrition data (mentioned in the first section), which was initally stored as a string of numbers, and turned it into a list, and then gave each value its own separate column. After adding this data to our main dataframe, we dropped the inital nutrition column and started looking at the data through some various styles of analyses.

I think I might try again and precook the macaroni and only use 2 eggs.  It was just very disappointing.’, ‘Very easy recipe, nice presentation.  I used 2 cups  skim milk and 1/3 cup half and half.  Followed recipe exactly but left out hot sauce.  Macaroni was slightly al dente.  If you prefer well cooked macaroni, par boil it first for a few minutes.  Let baked pie cool for at least 15 minutes with foil covering the top.  This will allow the pie to &quot;settle&quot; so that it slices  into nicely formed wedges.  Definitely worth a try.  Am serving this with sauteed porto bello mushroms, sliced, on top of pie wedge, accompanied by a green salad.’]</td>

I really wanted to like this one but I won't be making this again. Thanks for posting anyway.’, ‘I have made this recipe for years, and we really love it, however, I do change it a bit. I use a whole 8 ounce package of cream cheese and just something like 3-4 oz of cheddar or American. We add some salt and let it cook only as long as it takes to puff up and then take it out to cool. Overcooked it becomes dry and less flavorful. We cook it in a Corning Ware &lt;br/&gt;9 inch quiche plate which holds all the ingredients just right. One of our favorite uses for imitation crab.’]</td>

I loved not having to make my own crust in a springform pan like most cheesecakes call for.  Instead of putting pecan halves on top, I sprinkled chopped pecans around the rim of the cake…so pretty!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, everyone LOVED it!’, ‘This is wonderful!!! So easy to make. My family loved it.’, “DH says this is the best thing he has ever eaten.  Enough said?  I love being how easy it is, and that it tastes so good.  I also love that you don’t need 2 pounds of cream cheese and a springform pan for it - you can have it anytime!  Next time I make it, I’ll chop up the apple pie filling.  I also added more pecans to the top.  Glad I picked up enough ingredients for 2 pies!”, ‘My daughter made this for us on Sun. IT was so good. WE loved it. She has made it before. It is always a hit.’, “This recipe is very easy and tasty. Not only have I done this exact recipe, I have exchanged it with my peach preserves that I spiced like I would a peach cobbler. There are so many variations of fillings you can do. I’ve experimented with many and my family and friends have loved them all!!”]</td>

#### Univariate Data Analysis
We took an inital look at preparation time.

You can see that the boxplot has some significant outliers-- There is one recipe that takes 1.05 _million_ minutes! We will need to remove these outliers to do most of the data analysis.

Let's take a look at the top outliers:

My son decided he wanted something different for his birthday, so we made this cake.  He loved it and has already asked when we can make it again.  It's an extremely rich cake, so small pieces are in order, with ice cream or milk to balance it out."]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |      233.8 |          18 |      50 |        5 |         8 |              36 |              10 |

A couple of tips, the best info I found on making fruit infused vinegar said to use equal weights of vinegar &amp; fruit, let it infuse in a cool dark place for a minimum of 6 weeks. I would think this would be ideal for herb vinegars as well to give you a more intense flavour. We actually preferred using apple cider vinegar rather than wine vinegar for most of the infused vinegars I made. It seems to be a mellower finish. Now from experience, make your vinegars in a mason jar rather than the bottle you will gift them in. You need to strain your vinegar after infusing. Once it is strained you can decant it into the bottles you are using for gifting.']                                                                |       15.4 |           0 |       0 |        0 |         0 |               0 |               0 |

It appears that these are mostly pickling/marinating/fermenting recipes, which take a long time. Thankfully, the `tags` column contains a tag that labels recipes that take `1-day-or-more`-- We can filter those out.

We also took a look at the distributions of average ratings, and it appears that the vast majority of average ratings are positive. Even when increasing the histogram bin size (and increasing granularity), the rightmost bin consistently has the highest number of recipes.

#### Bivariate Data Analysis
We took a look at if there's any relation between the average user rating and prep time in a recipe, and found no great correlation. On the other hand, taking a look at the average protein to carb ration for many of the common tags did show some interesting results.

You can see (not surprisingly) that the recipes with the highest average protein to carb ratio are `low-carb` and `meat` recipes. Surprisingly, recipes labelled as `healthy` have some of the lowest protein to carb ratios in the top 25 most common tags.

#### Interesting Aggregates

Another way of visuallizing the data above in a less condensed way is with a grouped table:

Here, we have left the data in its raw form (ie. not in ratios).

#### Imputation

We have imputed the data to *remove* missing data. We did this because ultimately the imputed dataset is still large enough to be representative of the raw dataset, and ultimatlely it doesn't affect the appearance or shape of the data. See below:

`recipes_non_imputed.shape`
(1364760, 8)
`recipes_imputed = recipes_imputed.dropna()`
`recipes_imputed.shape`
(1364760, 8)

When examining only nutritional values, the imputed dataset has the same shape as the non-imputed dataset. So in this case, dropping NA values is sufficient (or not doing imputation at all).

### Framing a Prediction Problem

Our question is as such: when given a vector of nutritional values, the number of minutes needed to finish the recipe, and the average rating, what would be the predicted number of calories?

This question is a regression problem, since the `calories` column is numerical.
